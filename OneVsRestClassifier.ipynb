I don't know if all Mcdonald's are like that but the ones own by the owner of the ones in the area are so cheap, when did I have to pay extra just because I wanted 3 packs of ketchup for a meal of 6 bucks? that's why I told all my friends at work and an email to all my coworkers about 200 and they don't go there anymore.\",\n",

Saw a large billboard for Ike's Cook Shack and looked interesting.  One we found the place it looked intriguing so we gave it a go.  It's kind of small and but cosy round log cabin.  Ordered the hotcake stack with eggs and bacon.  Excellent!  Way too much food with three big plate sized sourdough pancakes.  My wife have an eggwhite omelet that was great too.  I recommend this place and I hope it does well.\",\n",

But so many things went wrong, it's hard to lie and say I want to go back. \\n\\nTo begin, we expected a wait, but we were surprised when we were asked to wait outside (as opposed to inside the door). Every table that came after us was also asked to sit outside. The wait time for a table was probably 20min. \\n\\nNext, we waited on our food. There were two large tables before us, unfortunately. We played cards to pass the time (nice touch) but got bored after another twenty minutes. \\n\\nWhen our food did arrive, each plate had been sloppily thrown together: one plate had burned bacon (black), all of the toast hadn't even been browned or cut in halves, the hash browns were more consistent with potato sticks and the eggs looked like they came from another planet.   My appetite dropped when the waitress gave me my plate-- not a good sign. \\n\\nAdd to this high level of noise (small restaurant with the kitchen and a closet of a bathroom just inches away from tables), plates being dropped on the floors, and the manager chastising her daughter/waitress in front of guests, I unfortunately predict that this restaurant will pass on like so many before it. \\n\\nSuggestions: come for a weekday breakfast to avoid the noise and the wait. And hopefully, their plates start coming out with a more appealing appearance. I doubt I will be back, returning only if I'm guilted into another visit.\",\n",
