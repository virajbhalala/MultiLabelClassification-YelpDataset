Did a quick yelp search and found this place that had just opened. \\n\\nIt was pretty empty at 1pm with only 4 tables occupied. Service was good except the kitchen messed up on our orders which is hard to believe as, with most Pho places, it's order by number. No biggie, the fixed it. \\n\\nOn to the Pho itself. First the size. The regular and large are not much different and the large is smaller then most place I've gone. The broth itself was OK but not anything special. The meat was lacking, not in quality but quantity. Overall it was a decent bowl of Pho but not something I would drive to in order to have. If I was in the area and needed a quick Pho fix, sure, but nothing more.\",\n",

       "       \"CURBSIDE TAKEAWAY REVIEW - \\n\\nI want to make sure it is clear that this review is related to the curbside takeaway only, and not the restaurant in general.  This only reflects my experience with the curbside team over the last couple of years.\\n\\nThe accuracy of my orders are incorrect more than they are correct.  This is a trend over the last 24 months.  We do not have complicated or modify the menu when ordering, we are talking about items not being included that should be.\\n\\nI recognize that we aren't saving the world here.  We have gone back to this location for takeaway over and over and over again.  The one job that Outback Curbside Takeaway has is to provide fast and accurate food as advertised.  It is on this expectation that I give a low one-star rating.\\n\\nLast night was the last straw - 1) the order was ready 35 minutes after the communicated pick up time via the website and follow up email, 2) we were missing one of the salads.  3)  The salad dressing we received was for the salad we did not get - and we did not get the dressing assigned to the salad we did get.  4)  The french fries were soggy / undercooked.  5)  The steak was cold.  6)  The bread did not come with butter/sides.\\n\\nI've noticed that it is typically the side salad that gets the shaft.  I have returned this location for curbside takeaway maybe 15 times over the last two years.  I've reached the point where I check the bag before I pull away and I no longer call the manager to complain.  I have hoped for the best because in general I really like Outback.  The only time we will be returning to this location is to dine in.  We've given curbside many many many second chances.\",\n",

So I got together with Robyn N., we stormed the place for lunch today, & I\\'m happy to report that this is still one of the very best Buffets in Arizona!\\n\\nAfter a chat with our attentive, super friendly server, I started with some of their wonderful Clam Chowder, which they make from scratch, with clams right out of the shell, not a can.  That was one of SEVEN soups to choose from today, among the 162 food items out, not counting dressings & sauces.\\n\\nAfter some salad & just-made Sushi, it was on to the Roast Duck, Mongolian BBQ with a variety of meats including SCALLOPS, & so on.  I don\\'t think any Asian Buffet in AZ can match this place, except Crazy Buffet & SOMETIMES the Pacific Seafood over in Glendale.  The quality, quantity, & variety of the food over there is similar, but attention to detail* been hit & miss for me during my 5 visits to that one.\\n\\nTHIS Pacific Seafood Buffet here has had 6 years to get all of their Peking Ducks in a row, & they don\\'t make any of those mistakes.  I\\'ve also been to this one 5 times, & I\\'ve always gotten consistently very friendly treatment, such an array of terrific food to choose from that it\\'s just amazing!     :-))\\n\\nLunch Buffet $8.88/$8.00 Sr.\\n\\nPS:  Chinese Buffets never have a full bar, but this one does!\\n\\n===============================================\\n\\n*  Examples:  Not having all the food out at opening time, cake that should be served at room temperature put out frozen, & having the ice cream temperature set so low that it\\'s very hard to scoop out.',\n",
